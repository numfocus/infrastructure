1. Please provide a brief description of your project's specific needs for AWS credits:

Running some batch jobs for SciPy on AWS. I was thinking about using an m4.large, and I'll probably want to set something up that will run approximately once daily, but I'm not sure how long it will take each run.
1. Please provide us with an estimated cost for meeting those needs (in U.S. Dollars):

$75 / mo

1. Are any of these needs particularly urgent or important? If so, please explain.

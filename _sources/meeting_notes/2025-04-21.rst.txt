Notes
=====

- New members will form the core of the committee.

  - New time will favour the new members available time over the existing members.
  - Optional (aka when they have free time) Andy, Irfan and Mridul

- Covered some project demands we got via emails for AWS credits.
- Covered rackspace servers to reduce the monthly bill.
- Review of servers again, who to contact with an open github issue to track this: https://github.com/numfocus/infrastructure/issues/60
- Hope to transition specific webpages to GitHub or another static service.
- Grants application(s):

  - What are valuable infrastructure initiatives for the projects?

    - CI/CD pieces that are longer than what you can do on github for free
    - Security audits
    - GPU requests, being able to support accelerators
    - Paid services that Github Actions offers
    - CoPilot Pro
  - What's a reasonable cost estimate?

    - Say 200$ a month per project.

      - Not all projects would need it but it provides a good total amount.
  - What are some potential funding sources?

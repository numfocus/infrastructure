Notes
=====

- We have access to ACCESS.
  - We need to work out how to give out access to projects and to what projects are asked.
  - Nabil recalls a survey which was sent out and will try to find it.
- AVS Benchmarking Costs
  - Addo has created a document which he will share with AstroPy.
  - Nabil suggested at those prices to look at other cloud platforms which provide dedicated servers for less.
- Nabil will be stepping down from the committee at the end of the year.
  He is not engaging with the open-source community anymore and feels it is best to have someone
  who is active within the broader community.

Action items
============

- Upload meeting notes to repo **Nabil Freij**
- Create an issue template for ACCESS to help Alex and others manage on https://github.com/numfocus/infrastructure **Nabil Freij**
- Find which projects wanted ACCESS access and contact them to give them accounts **Nabil Freij**
- Figure out how to renew the project as I don't think we will use all the credits in time. No cost extension? Might be worth emailing Alex about it. **Nabil Freij**
- Give Addo access to ACCESS **Nabil Freij**

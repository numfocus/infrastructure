Guide to CI/CD
--------------

- CirrusCI - NumPy and MD Analysis
  Provides what they need, Exotic hardware, Nice interface
- AWS - Chris Delp

The Committees goal is to make going from free to paid CI as easy as possible.
Need to write a bit on how to get the guide:

If people ask for credit:

- What about a NF org?

  - AWS

    - Use CI-RUN to integrate with Github Actions
    - allows the structure for sub orgs
    - the quota on the bill is hard
    - Needs active management

  - Cirrus-ci

    - Github Actions integration
    - Can buy credits

  - UbiCloud

    - Github Actions based, so easy to use
    - Willing to work with us on billing and customization

  - Github self hosted

    - Easiest to use, but often have exotic hardware but getting better: GPUs, windows on arm

- Expense card?

  - Can we generate virtual cards to hand out to projects with monthly quotas?
  - https://www.revolut.com/cards/virtual-card/ or https://www.pexcard.com/

Contents of a Guide
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CI

- What to consider when setting up a CI

  - Management
  - Hardware needs: This can limit what CI service you can pick

- Types of services available

  - IaaS (AWS, GCP, UbiCloud)
  - PaaS (Github Actions, Gitlab CI)

- Cost

  - Predict your costs
  - Testing frequency: per commit vs per pull request vs nightly vs weekly
  - How to pay for the service via numfocus

- Benchmarking

  - Benchmarking fundamentals
  - Machine requirements

    - If bare metal:

      - Who maintains it
      - Who manages access to projects
      - Quota or scheduling system

  - Frameworks

    - codspeed.io: Not open source, but "free" for OSS
    - ASV: Long in tooth but used frequently
    - ConBench: Lots of bloat so not easy to use

Feedback to Github:

- Matrix requires: https://github.com/OpenAstronomy/github-actions-workflows/blob/main/.github/workflows/tox.yml

Discussion boards:

- Discussed proposal: https://github.com/numfocus/TownHall/discussions/7

  - Would like to just open this document rather than post minutes
  - Seems like a good thing to post proposals like the one above
  - Update instructions to prefer issues over emailing, slacking, or pinging on github issues

Needs from NumFOCUS Staff:

- Pretalx account follow up

  - Have not heard back from NF Staff
  - Can the committee start the conversation?
  - Andy: I think we can certainly start conversations and get proposals but don't have signatory power
  - Mridul: can we just help nudge it along

- Interview process for new devops role

  - Committee sees opportunity to improve the process for the new hire

  - Clarify the committee role

    - Would like to have input on the hire
    - Can help sort resumes
    - Do we have a veto on candidates

- Summit invites to committee members

  - Nabil going with SunPy
  - Mridul invited via MDAnalysis, not sure if going
  - Andy going with Advisory Council

Action items
============

- Create a Google Forms survey which details - Nabil Freij

  - What CI services are using currently and what architectures do you use on them?
  - Do they need paid services? If so, what ones and how much (rough estimate)?
  - What architectures do you want to run on?

- Review Notes and remove private links - Nabil Freij
- Move the proposal for CI/CD guide to discussions - Andy Terrel
- Generate sphinx skeleton - Nabil Freij
- Start writing base guide - Andy Terrel
- Follow up with NumFOCUS Staff - Andy Terrel

Notes
=====

Summit:

- Program committee is working an introduction of all committees into the plenary sessions with a set unconference session
- Start thinking about any specific items to address with projects

Pretalx account follow up:

- Can the committee start the conversation?

  - Andy: I think we can certainly start conversations and get proposals but donâ€™t have signatory power
  - Mridul: can we just help nudge it along
  - Need to review spend for PyData sites on AWS and Rackspace
  - Need to review current setup and conversion to static site costs

Nicole - Cost of hosting for Pretalx:

- Unclear how much we are paying for our own version we host.
  The Static sites are pretty expensive
  - It's possible the new devdeps person can take on that load and it might be a cheaper solution.
  - Worry that the custom code from Mate would not be allowed but they are very happy to accept the code upstream.
- List price from pretalx.com (Estimate from older notes)

  - Pay by expected number of attendees and talks:

    - Large events: 1400 EUR / event
    - Small events: 900 EUR / event

  - Hosting 16 events: 16,900 EUR

    - 5 large events: 7000 EUR
    - 11 small events: 9900 EUR

- Current: ~$18,400

  - Server cost is around ~$50 a month per event

    - 12 month + 4 concurrent events: $2,400

  - Dev Time - $16,000

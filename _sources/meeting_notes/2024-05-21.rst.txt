Notes

Pretalx
-------

Marty sets up pretalx for events, proposal on the table to have it hosted by pretalx.com

Reasons to do it:
- Get our changes to the open source project
- Less cost on our staff to manage
- We get changes as soon as they come out

Notes from Marty on changes if we make to the stock pretalx:

The biggest change has been the edits to Pretalx's schedule widget (the embedded JavaScript that we insert into the conference site's schedule page to display the schedule).
I've added more advanced filtering so that the widget can show only specific submission types (e.g. only showing talks or tutorials) or specific conference days.
I fixed a bug where organizers were unable to change submission tracks.
I meant to push this upstream (and even created a pull request) but missed a question about additional testing that prevented it from being merged.
We added the ability to import reviewer assignments by CSV file (Pretalx only allowed this by JSON files).
We modified the proposal pages for SciPy conferences so that they would include reviewer feedback.
A custom navigation menu was added to Pretalx pages to better link the Pretalx server with conference sites.

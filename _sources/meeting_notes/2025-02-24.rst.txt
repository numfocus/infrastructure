    - Punt to the next meeting.

Notes
=====

- Alexandru joined to discuss ACCESS:
    - Showed a demo of the setup that he has running for bioconductor.
    - Using Jetstream2
    - He works on this alone, low maintenance.
    - Paid by NSF, it's all covered by them.
    - Access is open to the entire world.
    - Important as we have many projects which are not US-based.
    - Any issues with GDPR compliance?

      - No
    - Would need to ensure that a numfocus employee is able to maintain the system in case Alexandru leaves.
    - Long term, will NSF be able to fund it or will we need to switch to numFOCUS or project funding?
    - Also we also need to be clear what does funding mean here, it is human time or computer time. We need both to be sustainable.
    - No money exchanges hands, it's based on allocations of tokens.
    - We will need to advertise this to projects, if the application is successful.
    - Application needs

      - What services would you like turned on
      - What would projects use these services for (provide examples)
      - Annual report needed to provide what was used, how useful it was, how much money was saved etc

Action items
============

- Upload notes to the website
- Gauge interest in ACCESS from projects - looking for some projects that would be interested in a pilot project.
- Create google survey

Notes
=====

SDG Infrastructure - Proposals 2022 & 2023, it lacks information if any of the projects were funded or not.

Infrastructure requests
-----------------------

How involved should the committee be?

Review process for issues.
Committee could do that.
Can the committee help us decide what we should and should not support?
In the past NF has agreed to support requests that aren't directly related to NF projects but as we scale, we may not have enough bandwidth.

Action items
============

- Set up a mock budget for January submission (breakdown by project, select as many infrastructure projects) - Nicole Foster
- Create a draft document about a system for reviewing and responding to project requests - Nabil Freij
- Add information about which SDGs were funded - Nicole Foster

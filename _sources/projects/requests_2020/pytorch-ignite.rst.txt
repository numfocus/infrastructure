Request Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Please provide a brief description of your project's specific needs for AWS credits:

We would like to run several deep learning demo pipelines that will become part of the project's example gallery.
We need AWS credits to use EC2 Spot or On-Demand instances: p3.16xlarge or p3dn.24xlarge, EBS storage for datasets.

2. Please provide us with an estimated cost for meeting those needs (in U.S. Dollars):

We plan to run 1-2 trainings per month, computation costs only will be around 713.15 USD:

::

   Operating system (Linux), Storage for each EC2 instance (Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)), Storage amount (500 GB),
   Snapshot Frequency (No snapshot storage), Workload (Monthly, Baseline: 0, Peak: 2, Duration of peak: 2 Day 0 Hr 0 Min),
   Data transfer cost (0), Advance EC2 instance (p3.16xlarge), Pricing strategy (Spot)

3. Are any of these needs particularly urgent or important? If so, please explain.

All needs are equally important

4. Additional Comments:

We will explore other options at a lower cost if possible.

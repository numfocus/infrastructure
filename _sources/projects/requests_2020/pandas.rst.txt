We're considering using AWS for running the pandas benchmarks, but we need to experiment a bit first.
To see how many credits are being consumed, and whether we can get consistent hardware to compare among runs.

Would it be possible to get access to some NumFOCUS credits to experiment a bit, before we fill the official form?
I think AWS will be a great choice if it works, but not really sure it will.

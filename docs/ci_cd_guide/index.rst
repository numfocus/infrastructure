Paying for CI/CD with NumFOCUS
*****************************

As your open source project grows, the free tier of CI/CD services may no longer meet your needs. This guide helps you understand what options are available, estimate costs, and work with NumFOCUS to fund CI/CD services that keep your development moving fast.

Whether you need more parallel builds, exotic hardware like GPUs, or extended build times, NumFOCUS can help. We've worked with many projects to identify cost-effective solutions and have established relationships with CI/CD vendors to provide the best possible terms for open source projects.

What is CI/CD?
==============

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are practices that help development teams automate testing, building, and deployment of their code. CI/CD pipelines run automated tests on every commit or pull request to catch bugs early and ensure code quality before merging changes to the main branch.

Why Consider Paid CI/CD?
========================

While many CI/CD services offer free tiers sufficient for small projects, larger projects often need:

- More parallel builds to speed up testing
- Exotic hardware (GPUs, ARM processors, or specific architecture support)
- Custom runners for specialized workloads
- Longer build times and more frequent testing (nightly, on every commit)
- Better resource management and scheduling

Free tiers can become a bottleneck as your project grows. NumFOCUS can help fund CI/CD services for eligible projects, making it easy to transition from free to paid tiers without the burden on project budgets.

How NumFOCUS Helps
==================

The NumFOCUS Infrastructure Committee works to:

1. **Provide guidance** on selecting appropriate CI/CD services for your project's needs
2. **Facilitate funding** for paid CI/CD services through NumFOCUS
3. **Share best practices** on CI setup, cost estimation, and optimization
4. **Connect projects** with vendors and negotiate favorable terms

This guide will help you:

- Understand what to consider when setting up CI
- Explore different CI service options
- Estimate and predict costs
- Set up benchmarking for performance-critical projects
- Learn how to request funding from NumFOCUS

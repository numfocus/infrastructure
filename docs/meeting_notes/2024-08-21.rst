Notes
=====

Pretalx Proposal Decision
-------------------------

- It seems to be a cheaper option than currently
- Nicole and Jim need to get proper quote and moving forward

  - Jim is concerned about getting quick support

    * Can this be part of the contract?

- Need to decide if Marty's work on Pretalx would fall under the DevOp role
- Decision: wait to pursue after we hire devop role

DevOps Role
------------

- Currently 2k+ applications have around ~13 in a shortlist
- Infrastructure committee wants to be involved in the technical interview

  - Need to come up with some fixed questions to ask them
  - Want to ensure that the interview is the same across all candidates

NF Summit
----------

- There will be one unconference session on the infrastructure committee

  - Want to bring up CI/CD guide
  - See if people know about the new process for requests from the committee
  - Do committees need common infrastructure that we can set up?

    * Possible to unify how we do voting, notes and requests?
    * Want to improve transparency?

CI/CD Guide
------------

- Skeleton setup on the repo. Now we can add the information needed

Action Items
============

- Create a Google Forms survey which details: Nabil Freij

  - What CI services are using currently and what architectures do you use on them?
  - Do they need paid services? If so, what ones and how much (rough estimate)?
  - What architectures do you want to run on?

- ~~Claudia - Create Calendly for Nabil, Andy, and Mridul for interviews (I'll create a group chat amongst us all to coordinate)~~

  - ~~First interview- technical interview, add in fixed 85k rate in email send to Andy nvidia's email for faster response~~
  - ~~Create spreadsheet tracking candidates stages (contacted, interested, etc)~~

- ~~Andy, Mridul and Nabil: Create a checklist of questions to ensure a fair interview process via a shared Google Doc~~
